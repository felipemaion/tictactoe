TicTacToc == Jogo da Velha
==========================

This is my second project in Python.
It is a very popular Game called TicTacToe (Jogo da Velha).

How to use:
-----------

Clone or download this project to a folder.
After that you can run the pre-loaded game::

python tictactoe.py

Or just create a new one as shown at the very last lines of the tictactoe.py file.

.. code-block:: python

    from tictactoe import *
    game = Game("Player 1", "Player 2", matches = 3)
    game.play()
  
  
Code is in English, but Game is in Portuguese. 

ToDo:
-------
1- Implement to play online.

2- Implement Artificial Inteligence.

3- Improve readability of the code.
